### MobX
![MobX data-flow](https://mobx.js.org/docs/flow.png)
- Basic concept:
  - `Observable state.` Any value that can be mutated and might serve as source for computed values is state. MobX can make most types of values (primitives, arrays, classes, objects, etc.) and even (potentially cyclic) references observable out of the box.
  - `Computed values.` Any value that can be computed by using a function that purely operates on other observable values. Computed values can range from the concatenation of a few strings up to deriving complex object graphs and visualizations. Because computed values are observable themselves, even the rendering of a complete user interface can be derived from the observable state. Computed values might evaluate either lazily or in reaction to state changes.
  - `Reactions.` A reaction is a bit similar to a computed value, but instead of producing a new value it produces a side effect. Reactions bridge reactive and imperative programming for things like printing to the console, making network requests, incrementally updating the React component tree to patch the DOM, etc.
  - `Actions.` Actions are the primary means to modify the state. Actions are not a reaction to state changes but take sources of change, like user events or incoming web-socket connections, to modify the observable state.

- Ability requirement
  - @observable, @observer, @computed, @action
  - when(), reaction(), autorun()
  - configure strict mode and init/reset store in action
  - split domain state and UI state
  - debug use MobX Developer Tools
  - organize store in large scale web application
  - use mobx-state-tree when necessary
  - use mobx-utils when necessary
